This is a student open-source project with the intention of creating a real working DanceDanceRevolution game using Qt, SDL/SFML, VLC, and a number of other libraries for sound analysis. Though the name of the application may be changed in the future, it has been code-named to SADStep after the names of the creators, i.e. Sebastian, Adam, Daniel, Scott.

At the moment there are no binary releases, however given a copy of Qt Creator you should be able to compile and run from source. No songs are provided however.

Also, at the moment we are either busy transitioning the code over from primarily Qt to primarily SDL, or adding SFML support, so binary releases will be further delayed.
